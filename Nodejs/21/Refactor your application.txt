Refactor your application

In this exercise you'll build on what you created in 'Unit 15, Exercise 1: Handle file uploads'.

Refactor your API application so that:

Application configuration is accessed via one module (config.ts).
The routes are in their own module and imported into app.ts.
All middleware are organised under a middleware directory, and imported where they're needed.
