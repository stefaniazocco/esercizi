Implement authentication

In this exercise you'll build on what you created in 'Exercise: Refactor your application'.

Implement authentication for your API. You should:

Integrate Passport, the GitHub2 Passport strategy and the Express session middleware.
Create a GitHub OAuth App and configure your application to use it.
Add routes for handling the login and logout process.
Protect the POST, PUT and DELETE routes on your API.
Set a username on resources when they're created or updated.
Create a web page for adding a resource, so that you can test the authentication.
